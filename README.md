## Rules of blackjack
- The player and the dealer each start with 2 cards.
- All cards are worth their respective number of points. Aces can be worth 1 or 11. J, Q, K are each worth 10.
- The player then has the option to 'hit' or 'stick'.
- If the player's total is less than 17 then they must 'hit'.
- 'hit' draws the player one more card, updating their total.
- The dealer then chooses to hit if the dealer has less than 17 points, otherwise the dealer will choose to 'stick'.
- Exceeding 21 points instantly loses the game.
- Once someone has chosen to 'stick' they can no longer draw cards.
- The game ends once both people have chosen to stick.
- At the end of the game whoever is closest to 21 wins.
- 'Blackjack' is achieved when someone sticks with just 2 card and those 2 cards contain an ace and a picture card (J, Q, K).
- Blackjack is the most valuable score someone can receive and is worth more than any other combination totalling 21.
- If both the player and the dealer score a blackjack then the game is a draw.
- If the player and the dealer have equal scores then the person with the most cards in their hand wins.
- If both scores are equal and both people are holding the same number of cards then the game is a draw.
